## Welcome to my GitHub Pages Porfolio

I have been interested in computer science for a long time but I am new to computer programming. I enjoy working with computers, creating content and finding solutions. Currently focusing on core web browser languages: HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript. I’m looking forward to working remotely on front-end Web Development on 2022. Here you’ll find the projects in which I have completed for Full Stack Development on MITxPRO.
