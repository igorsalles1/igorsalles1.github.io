    <h1> Bio </h1>
    <h2>
    <p>I have been interested in computer science for a long time but I am new to computer programming. 
      I enjoy working with computers, creating content and finding solutions. 
      On my bootcamp I'm urrently focusing on core web browser languages: HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript. 
      I’m looking forward to working remotely on front-end Web Development on 2022. 
      Here you’ll find the projects in which I have worked on for the Full Stack Development course on MITxPRO.
